## Large Scale Coastal Mapping
The intertidal coastal zone of the Wadden Sea consists of saltmarshes and adjacent mudflats. The zone is important because of its natural values ​​and because it protects the land against flooding. However, it is threatened by accelerating sea level rise. Knowledge about sedimentation, erosion and the interaction with vegetation is central to gain a better understanding of the growth capacity of the saltmarshes and mudflats.

RPAS-based mapping combined with Structure-from-Motion photogrammetry enables the creation of accurate, high-resolution maps and 3D models. Since 2019, we have been collaborating with the University of Twente, Blik van Boven, and ATMOS UAV to conduct large-scale mapping of intertidal zones. Our Marlyn VTOL allows us to survey approximately 600 hectares with a ground sampling distance (GSD) of around 10 millimeters in just 3-4 hours.

Orthomosaics enable us to classify landscapes into distinct categories such as mudflats and different vegetation types, providing a comprehensive view of environmental changes over time. By comparing digital elevation models (DEMs), we can precisely assess erosion and sedimentation patterns across extensive areas. Our approach allows for detailed analysis of landscape transformations, particularly in understanding how human-made structures impact coastal and intertidal environments, revealing subtle yet significant ecological responses to infrastructure development.
