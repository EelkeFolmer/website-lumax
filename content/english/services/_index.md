SalmonVision is a collaborative initiative developing hardware and AI-powered tools for automated salmon counting and species identification from underwater video, sonar, and drone surveys, aimed at providing timely population monitoring data for fisheries management. In this initiative we collaborate with the **Pacific Salmon Foundation**, **Wild Salmon Center** and **Simon Fraser University**. We have deployed a web application that enables end-to-end workflow management, from data upload through AI analysis to human verification. We are collaborating with First Nations, resource managers, and local communities across British Columbia's coast.
